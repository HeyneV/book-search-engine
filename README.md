Description
This project I took and existing book search engine and added the ability for a user to create an account, login and logoff of the book search engine. The ability to search for a book and then save that book.

Usage
To use this Book Search Engine a user can first Sign Up to create an account. If the user already has an account, they can simply Login. Once an user is logged into their account, they can then type the name of a book in the search bar and then click Submit Search button. Once this is done then a list of books will appear. The user can then click the Save this Book button (the button is their, but does not save - still a work in progress). Then the user can go to to See Your Books and see the books they have saved.
